# Using Rails as an API

## Introduction

Now that you have gotten familiar with asynchronous requests in JavaScript,
we're going to take a brief step back and revisit Rails for a few lessons. Rails
itself can serve as both the frontend and backend of a website, but it can also
be configured specifically to work as an API.

This becomes particularly handy now that we know how to use JavaScript to handle
everything in the browser (on the _frontend_).

With some practice building APIs in Rails, combined with your skills with fetch
in JavaScript, you will be able to build full stack applications by the end of
this section.
